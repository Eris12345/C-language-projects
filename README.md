Text-Into-Two-Dim-Array
->A C program that reads letters from a text file named words.txt into a two-dimensional array. In each column of the array, there is an English word. For example, the word “house” is written in the first column and “choir” is written in the last column. The program will take a number input and copy the corresponding word from the two-dim array into a one-dim array. Then the program will display the contents of the one-dim array.



******************************************************************************************************

Matrix-Calculation
->A modular C program that reads a 5x5 integer square matrix from a file named Q2.txt and displays a menu as shown in the example run below, the program, then, displays the selected option until Exit from the menu is chosen by the user. Note that each  menu item must be a function to ensure proper modularity, write your functions for them to be sound and valid.

Text_and_Balance_Menu
->A program that reads account id and balance for several customers from the file customers.txt into two parallel arrays with the maximum size 30, and allows a credit manager to obtain the list of the customer’s accounts with zero balances (i.e. customers who do not owe any money), the customer having the maximum balance. 

The program displays a menu and allows the credit manager to enter one of three options to obtain the information. And performs the appropriate operations according to the menu options by using a function for each.

Car_Wash_Company
->A carwash company has 3 washing lanes and a small parking lot for 7 cars. The washing lanes has a single entrance where only one car can pass at a time. When a car arrives (‘A’) it passes through the parking lot and enters the washing lanes if there is an empty lane. At the beginning, assume the lanes are full (cars 45NMH69, 35FDG63 and 15DER12 are being washed). When a car is washed and wants to depart (‘D’) that car has to be moved out of the lane. If there are cars which have entered the lanes after this car, they have to be moved out first (and of course moved in back to continue to be washed). And then a car that is waiting in the parking lot will be moved into the washing lane.
Meanwhile, remember that the parking lot (waiting cars) has a capacity as well, therefore, if the capacity is reached and new cars are arriving to be washed, they will not be allowed to enter the parking lot.
You will write the car_wash function and do not forget also to create the car_wash.txt file to be able to use in your program. Your txt file content is given above. Then write a main program to test your function. You will read the information of the car from your text file and use the Car_Wash() function and print the queue after each operation.

linked_list
->A modular C program that reads several words from the text file words.txt, creating a linked list of them, and displays the list on the screen. Then, the program asks for strings, and displays the words starting or ending with each string, until the user enters ??
